# Challenge 8: CLI Vehicle Builder

## Description

This command-line application enables users to create, select, and interact with various types of vehicles. Originally designed to work with cars, the application has now been updated to include options for trucks and motorbikes. Users can add new vehicles or work with existing ones, perform actions on selected vehicles, and see the results directly in the command line.
